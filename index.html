					<h4>Early Colonial America</h4>
				</header>
				<p>In early colonial America, women played an important role in keeping towns and villages sustainable. In New England, family values and the protestant religion sent pilgrims to the New World as complete families. Towns could sustain and grow their populations naturally and this culture eventually led to high urbanization and industrialization in the North East. In contrast, the South and Mid Atlantic regions brought young men to the New World in hopes of making a fortune. For this reason very few women came to the South and Mid Atlantic during the early colonial period, creating unstable populations and a need to pay women to go across the Atlantic. Women in the colonial period of America played an important role in raising the next generation of colonists, it is no wonder that this idea evolved into republican motherhood during the American Revolution.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="RepMotherhood">
				<header>
					<h4>Republican Motherhood</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The idea of republican motherhood was important during the American revolution. It was the idea that the role of women in the late 1700s was to raise the next generation of patriots. The acceptance of republican motherhood as the social norm shows the prevalence of the separate spheres during this time period even though it was perpetuated much more during the industrial revolution. Women were expected to stay at home in their domestic sphere and raise their children while men fought directly for their country. This time period did see an expansion of education for women so they could more effectively raise the next generation.
				</p>

			<article id="WorkingFactories">
				<header>
					<h4>Working in Factories</h4>
				</header>
				<p>As more factories opened at the beginning of the industrial revolution, many more opportunities were created for young women. While rights and safety were limited in factories such as ones in Lowell, Massachusetts factory labor was the first real opportunity for women to have financial freedom and support their families financially. However the onset of the industrial revolution hardened the idea of separate spheres into American values. It was easier to differentiate between the public and private spheres and keep more women in the home after marriage. In addition to these non-legislative changes in gender roles caused by a changing economy, many feminists started to seek legislative changes for women’s rights in the 19th century as well.
				</p>

			<article id="SenecaFalls">
				<header>
					<h4>Senca Falls</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 produced the Declaration of Sentiments which outlined the feminist agenda and other grievances about gender roles in America, including suffrage for women and equal treatment under the law. As the first convention for women’s rights it inspired many later conventions, and laid the groundwork for the main suffrage movement in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This event is one of the most important in the long fight for equal rights in America, and is one of the first times that women’s rights has been recognized on a national level in America.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="19thAmend">
				<header>
					<h4>19th Amendment</h4>
				</header>
				<p>First-wave feminism was the movement throughout the world with a main goal of women’s suffrage. The movement ended after the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 and the onset of the roaring twenties. The 19th amendment was the culmination of the first national women’s rights movement starting at the Seneca Falls Convention. The movement of the early 20th century was also mixed with temperance, which could have given women more power at home. This crucial movement for equality focused more on formal and political issues than the economic and reproductive issues of the late 1900s’ second-wave feminism.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="SecondWave">
				<header>
					<h4>Second Wave Feminism</h4>
				</header>
				<p>After the passing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbade discrimination based on sex in addition to race, national origin, and religion, feminism experienced a major revival. This time, unlike the first wave, feminists focused on economic issues such as equal pay for equal work, and the many various reproductive debates including abortion, birth control, and sexuality. While the fight for reproductive rights was successful, it was and is still the target of harsh criticism and legal disputes across the country. The issues fought for during the second wave saw improvement, but many still need to make more progress, and others need to maintain their progress.

					<h4>Bacon's Rebellion</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Led by Nathaniel Bacon in 1676, Bacon’s Rebellion was the first major demonstration of wealth inequality in American history. Bacon led a group of commoners for the seemingly benevolent cause of gaining recognition for the common man. While the rebellion did achieve this, some question Bacon’s true motives, the uprising could have been an attempt to oust Governor Berkeley who had previously shorted common folk on their rights to expand and vote, and prevented Bacon in his own expansion on Indian land. Despite Bacon’s true intentions, the revolt remains very important in American history as the first time the common man’s problems were the focus. The motivations of the rebellion extend to the election of Andrew Jackson, and his appeal to the common man to expand territory and decrease the power of the federal government.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="JacksonClass">
				<header>
					<h4>Rise of the Common Man</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Andrew Jackson was inaugurated in 1829 with his strong appeal to the common man. His highly controversial Indian Removal Act led to the safety and allowed for the expansion of private territory, and his poorer background led to his victory over the aristocratic John Quincy Adams. After his wild inauguration party, where he allowed many common men into the white house to celebrate, critics called his time in office a mob rule because of his strong and loyal appeal to the average voter. Jackson’s refusal to renew the Bank of the US also shows how his appeal for the common man developed, the bank had policies against the lower classes and in favor of the higher classes so it is only natural for the middle and lower classes to support him. The rise of the common man during Jackson’s presidency relates to the concerns of the government during the progressive era because it shows an increase in the need for concern for the common man even though the role of the common man changed from farmer to factory worker.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="ProgressiveMvmt">
				<header>
					<h4>Progressive Movement</h4>
				</header>
				<p>While the progressive movement was more for the public purpose than Jackson’s rise of the common man, there are still similarities in the motives for each movement. The progressive movement saw an increase in unionization and workers rights along with increased government intervention to accomplish their goals. While the methods were different, the rise of the common man and the progressive movement had the same goal, to increase the power of and guarantee more rights to the common man. The time period of the early 1900s, a time of public interest and increased government, contrasts clearly with the gilded age, a time of public interest and little government intervention.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="GildedAge">
				<header>
					<h4>Gilded Age</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Gilded Age, known for its economic prosperity, little or no government intervention, and local political machines, is a prime example of private interest. Rulers of political machines like New York’s Boss Tweed unofficially controlled municipalities through the manipulation of voters and high income. The presidents during this time are sometimes referred to as the forgotten presidents because they passed little legislation to interfere with the booming economy that, along with a poor working class, gave the time period its name. Time periods like the Gilded Age with rich surfaces and poor centers start with private interest, and end when the people move towards public purpose, much like the Affluent Society that built up after World War II.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="AffluentSociety">
				<header>
					<h4>Affluent Society</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Much like the Gilded Age of the 1800s, the Affluent Society of the 1900s got its name from the stark differences between the upper and lower classes. The economic boom at the end of World War II created a wealth boom for the upper classes, without much change for the lower class. The growing income gap created many problems for the working class as politicians mostly looked at the surface for information regarding the wellbeing of the economy, and did not realize many of the problems that laid under the surface of the prosperous private sector. The ignorance towards the middle and lower classes has led to the appeal of Richard Nixon in the 1970s and Donald Trump in 2016 who both campaigned for the “Silent Majority” and promised to end thier mistreatment.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="TrumpClass">
				<header>
					<h4>Appeal of Donald Trump</h4>
				</header>
				<p>In the 2016 election Donald Trump emerged victorious through his demagogic appeal to the silent majority. He promised to fight for the working class by bringing jobs back to America and fight against their mistreatment. The lower classes have often been shorted attention and aid in in the federal government during times like the Gilded Age where politicians focus on the positives such as high GDP and low unemployment, and this can lead to overwhelming support for politicians that fight for their good. Similarly to Bacon, the true motives of Donald Trump are unclear, despite refusing the presidential salary, Trump’s businesses could experience immense growth in income and power. In addition to this, some of Trump’s proposed policies in healthcare and the budget could harm his major supporters the most.

			<article id="EarlySlavery">
				<header>
					<h4>Early Slavery</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Early slavery started in America as a more profitable substitution for indentured servitude, but quickly grew to the booming industry that allowed the South to grow in early American history. The first generations of slaves that came across the Atlantic on overcrowded ships often have the most horrific stories. Equiano’s memoir which depicted his journey into America had examples of slaves jumping overboard to be freed for the tortures of the cargo bay. Because this was mostly the first generation of slaves in America, their identity as Africans was strongest and their resilient culture shows this in the slave songs that were passed from generation to generation. Of course the institution of slavery was not mutually beneficial so many tried to escape, and some found this opportunity in the American Revolution.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="AfricanAmericanAmRev">
				<header>
					<h4>Role in the American Revolution</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Though the American Revolution was not intended as a vessel to end slavery and promote equal rights by the majority of the framers, under the dual revolution theory, the fight for independence extended to class struggles. Many blacks hoped that this second revolution would extend to them, but it was futile. Washington specifically ordered his subordinates to not recruit blacks, but on the British side, commanders welcomed escaped slaves into their camps to fight for them in exchange for freedom. After thousands of African Americans took up Lord Dunmore on his offer for freedom, Washington revoked his exclusion on them and from that point on, blacks supported both sides of the war with important manpower in hopes of winning their freedom and others.

			<article id="Mass54">

					<h4>Massachusetts 54th Regiment</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Civil War quickly turned from a fight for state’s rights into a fight against slavery, so it is only natural that freed slaves and African Americans fought for their freedom in the war. This however took a long time, the Massachusetts 54th Infantry Regiment was the first all black infantry to fight for the Union Army, and first saw active duty in March of 1963, after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. Speeches by Alfred Green and others encouraged many to join the army when possible and instilled much pride and patriotism for African Americans in the US. Of the abolitionists that would have fought in black regiments in the Civil War, there were many kinds with different end goals. One of these kinds was a promotion of Black Nationalism.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="BlackNationalism">
				<header>
					<h4>Black Nationalism</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Black Nationalism promoted an independent nation for freed slaves and blacks in Africa where they could be free and return to their original culture. However this style of abolition mostly failed. In addition to nightmarish logistical problems, most slaves were separated from Africa by many generations and would have trouble integrating into a new African nation. Black Nationalism was supported by Abraham Lincoln and David Walker in his Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World. Both argued that freed blacks would not fit in American society, so they supported their relocation into Africa. However, the Black Nationalist movement did have long lasting effects, during the Civil Rights Movement, a new black nationalist movement arose, Pan Africanism.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="PanAfrican">
				<header>
					<h4>Pan Africanism</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Pan Africanism movement started with the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 60s. While the new movement based on Black Nationalism from a century prior had similar ideals, there were key differences. Pan Africanism focused on the unionization of all natives to Africa, but also focused on the belief that Africans could not fit into foreign society, and to prosper in a modern world, they needed to unite. Many argue that Pan Africanism was the inspiration for the Civil Rights Movement, the ideals of black unity and equality in Africa inspired the fight for equality in America.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="CivilRightsMvmt">
				<header>
					<h4>Civil Rights Movement</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The civil rights movement was the second big step among many small ones for racial equality in America, the first step being abolition. For 100 years, African-Americans lived free but still suffered under Jim Crow laws, sharecropping, and other means of disenfranchisement. Finally, in the 1960s, the federal government puts and official end to segregation and other discriminatory legislation. Unfortunately, the new changes did not make an immediate difference in society, and much faux discrimination and segregation exists to this day. African American history is a story of fighting for rights, it came in a few large steps, but generally many painstaking small fights for equality which still last today.

			<article id="ColumbianExchange">
				<header>
					<h4>Columbian Exchange</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Columbian exchange was almost entirely devastating for the native people of America. Foreign diseases such as measles and chickenpox effortlessly decimated populations and aided in the more formal takeovers across the land. Not long after the original contact with the Aztec Empire, it fell to spanish rule and led to the feudal encomienda system across central America and the South West. The Columbian Exchange was the first showing of technological differences between the two worlds, and how easily Europe could subjugate the Native Americans. While there were many struggles after the original falls to colonists, the last major attempt and ability to fight was in Metacom’s War in 1675.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="Metacom">
				<header>
					<h4>Metacom's War</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Metacom(King Philip)’s War is often remembered as the last attempt of North East Indians to remove New England Colonists from their land. Tensions in the region had been building up over the years as prolonged subjugation by colonists raised Native American fears of the Old World and the people from it living in their lands. Metacom’s War was not the only Native American uprising, just 30 years earlier, the Pequot War took place, and about 75 years later, the French and Indian War, the main precursor to the American Revolution. These many uprisings show cause for radical fear and relocation of Native Americans in policies such as Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="IndianRemovalAct">
				<header>
					<h4>Indian Removal Act</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Indian Removal Act was a horrible event in Native American history. Thousands of Cherokees were forced to move out of their native land and into the territories of Oklahoma where they were placed in close proximity to tribes of vastly different cultures with far less land than in their native territory. While it is no doubt that Jackson’s policies were horrible, most of the debate comes from whether the Indian removal was necessary. The Act is often seen by historians as the lowest point in Jackson’s presidency in addition to his removal of the Bank of the US. Even during its time, the Indian Removal Act faced opposition, mostly by Native Americans, but also by Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Davy Crockett. The subjugation and patronization of Native Americans continued after the IRA including many massacres and battles during the period of expansion, notably the Wounded Knee Massacre.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="WoundedKnee">
				<header>
					<h4>Wounded Knee</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Wounded Knee was one of the most brutal and one sided massacre during American
				expansion west. United States forces were ordered to take control of Native American land in South Dakota. During this process, A troop of soldiers came across a village of Indians and had to disarm and relocate them to take control of their land. The resulting conflict was between nearly 500 US soldiers and only 350 Indians most of whom had their weapons taken. As many as 300 Indians died including men, women, and children. The story of the Wounded Knee massacre is truly horrific, especially considering the whole Native American Narrative, generally peaceful people, constantly forced into confinement and their way of life ruined, even when risking their lives to help the United States, especially during World War II.

			<article id="RoleWWII">

					<h4>Role in WWII</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Navajo Code Talkers played a very important role in the pacific campaign of World War II. Their unique language allowed for confidential communication between various locations on the front and in America without danger of important communications being intercepted and used against America. The Navajo Code was used up to the Vietnam war for the same reasons as WWII. Despite their immense loyalty to their country to serve in the war, even though they had been patronized for decades, most Native American veterans were not honored and respected to the same degree as white veterans. The negative treatment of Native Americans after their crucial role in WWII just shows how the overall view of the natives in society changed little over the course of American history, just like the Indian Occupation of Alcatraz island, the federal government and American citizens have ignored the rights and requests of Indians for generations.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="AIM">
				<header>
					<h4>Occupation of Alcatraz</h4>
				</header>
				<p>In late 1969, a group of Indians landed on Alcatraz island, requesting funds for a culture center and university, when refused, they began a 19 month long protest to occupy the island and fight for their protection under the government. The occupation period was one of struggle for the Native Americans, who were trying to gain recognition under the federal government and more rights that were guaranteed, but never delivered in generations old treaties. Overall, the history of Native Americans is one of fighting for recognition and freedom when a patronizing government or colonists take them away, whether it is through forced treaties, relocation, or lack of recognition for achievement, Indians have long been unfairly represented by the government.

				<h2>American Exceptionalism</h2>
			</header>

			<article id="CityOnHill">
				<header>
					<h4>A City Upon A Hill</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The idea of a city sitting upon a hill came from John Winthrop as his vision for the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He said that the colony should be a role model for the rest and should be looked up to as all people would to a city sitting on a hill. This idea spread to encompass all of America, and became the embodiment of American exceptionalism, that America is the city upon a hill, and the rest of the world should look up to them and model their governments after America’s. This was a very popular idea, especially during the Cold War when Ronald Reagan used the analogy as the main idea for his farewell address. Although the idea of being revered by other nations has changed over time, such as the transition to Civilizing Native Americans, the idea that America is a model country has persisted through time.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="SpreadingCivilization">
				<header>
					<h4>Spread of Civilization</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The spread of civilization is often used to excuse imperialism and expansion into unclaimed territories, and America is no exception. The spread of civilization was used as a justification for slavery and many of the horrific indian policies during the 19th century. Americans had the idea that the United States is a special society and it should work to spread its ideals onto unwilling peoples. This insistence on the spread of democracy as the reason for American interference in many conflicts shows American Exceptionalism as the cause for many long lasting and, and sometimes detrimental, policies in America. Manifest Destiny is a more specific example of how American Exceptionalism influenced policies through the spread of civilization.
				</p>

			<article id="ManifestDestinyException">
				<header>
					<h4>Manifest Destiny</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The famous manifest destiny picture features an angelic figure following pioneers along their journey with westward expansion. The figure is holding a school book and is carrying telegraph cables out west with the pioneers. This idyllic picture of manifest destiny shows that Americans believed they were spreading their unique culture and ideals through westward expansion. The idea of spreading democracy has remained unchanged as a goal in American history, however the means to this method have changed. In the 1800s, exceptionalism took the form of manifest destiny, and during the cold war, exceptionalism took the form of containment and domino theory.

					<h4>Vietnam War</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Vietnam War was one of the proxy wars with the Soviet Union during the cold war. Argument and support for the war came as a defense of democracy in Asia following the domino theory. The theory stated that if one more Asian country fell to communism, all would. American exceptionalism would not allow a country to fall to communism when possible, so along with Korea, the United States entered a war to promote democracy and capitalism in Asia. Unfortunately, this new method of showing American exceptionalism was far less successful and far more costly. More bombs were dropped in Vietnam than all of WWII, and in the process of keeping communism out of countries, many times, the US supported dictatorships that were just as bad. Fortunately, American exceptionalism did promote positive change domestically in the Civil Rights Movement.

			<article id="ColdWarCivilRights">
				<header>
					<h4>Role of the Cold War in the Civil Rights Movement</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Cold War was able to inspire social change at home in America. John F. Kennedy argued that the Soviet Union was using the fact that American states supported or ignored civil rights violations as propaganda to show that America is not a supporter of human rights. This would of course lower the power and influence of American exceptionalism which would not be good in a war of ideals with the Soviet Union. Supporters of civil rights used the legitimization of exceptionalism as one of many reasons for reform. After the attacks on September 11th, the role of American exceptionalism was once again invigorated as a reason for influence in the middle east - to spark more democratic forms of rule.

			<article id="WarOnTerror">

					<h4>Spread Of Democracy in the War on Terror</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Inspiration of democracy in nondemocratic nations, but without force, is a small cited reason for entrance into conflicts in the middle east during the war on terror. While small, this is an important reason and highlights the importance that American exceptionalism still has today. Insistence and inspiration of democracy in the middle east relates back to the Vietnam and Korean Wars when America entered wars to contain communism and allow the spread of democracy. A similar situation happens in the middle east, western entrance into the conflicts to spread democracy and depose dictatorships. Over American history, the ideals and goals of American Exceptionalism have stayed mostly the same, but the methods to achieve these goals has changed.

					<h4>American Revolution</h4>
				</header>
				<p>During the American Revolution, and early in the lifetime of the country, the role of the federal government was a highly contested topic. Federalists saw the role of the government to have more power while the democratic-republicans saw it to have less power. The ideal amount of power for federalists varied, but included a loose understanding of the constitution and what powers the government had, so power could be increased as needed. The ideal amount of power for democratic republicans was very little. Most saw the federal government as necessary for international relations such as war, trade and diplomacy and little else. This differing view connects to the contract and compact idea of the American constitution, whether the document was legally binding, or an agreement. The idea of role of state in society has varied greatly with time between periods of strong and less powerful federal governments.

					<h4>Gilded Age</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The gilded age is known for being a time of economic prosperity with little government intervention. This was a time filled with conservative economic policies such as laissez faire and supply side economics. The low power of federal government allowed large companies to grow without harmful regulations and give the age its name. The Gilded Age is an important example of a time period where the state has little role in private, and even public life. After the Gilded Age, American policies followed Schlesinger’s pendulum, towards a stronger government in the populism and progressive movements of the late 1800s and early 1900s.

					<h4>Populism</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Populism was characterized by protests against both major parties in the federal government for ignoring the needs and economic well being of farmers after the Gilded Age. The party asked for a buffer during depressions, subsidies for farmers and control of banks and corporations. This is a clear increase in the power of the federal government and the will of the people following the period of little federal intervention. Later the populist movement’s ideals were revived in the progressive movement which focused more on urban regulations than agrarian ones. There was a much larger increase than the populist movement in the will for federal power after the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 and election of Franklin D. Roosevelt with his popular New Deal program.

					<h4>New Deal</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The New Deal was FDR’s response to the Great Depression and how to handle the economy. The power of the federal government increased significantly during this time with the creation of social security and banking regulations to help stabilize the economy. FDR’s increased power was questioned especially during the court packing incident where he tried to introduce a new supreme court justice for all members over about 70 years, allowing him to appoint up to six new justices. The power of FDR’s New Deal continued with Truman’s Fair Deal, John F. Kennedy’s New Frontier, and Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society until the rise of the New Right with the elections of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.

					<h4>New Right</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The New Right was based on three fundamental principles, anticommunism, religious traditionalism, and lastly free market economics. The rise of presidents in the New Right such as Ronald Reagan shows the shift in American sentiments about the federal role in society backing down towards a less important role economically. Again this shift follows the pendulum of economic policies away from more liberal policies and towards conservative ones. This period of private interest is just one more example of the changing views of the role of state in society. The majority of the population does begin to shift more towards public purpose again in the present day with the creation of many regulations on large companies.

					<h4>Regulations - Environment</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The creation of many present day regulations, especially about the environment, is a highly contested debate in modern politics, as it was through all of history. Arguments against these regulations say that they would create unnecessary obstacles for businesses, while arguments for these regulations say that they can create a healthier environment and better living conditions for the entire population. Once again, these debates fall into the argument of private interest against regulations, and public purpose for regulations.

					<h4>Washington's Farewell Address</h4>
				</header>
				<p>George Washington’s farewell address set a strong precedent for over 150 years of not creating permanent alliances and treaties with other nations. He argued that long term treaties would be very risky for America and unnecessary in most occasions. This policy worked for America and lasted until the creation of NATO in 1949. An example of how this policy worked well for America is in World War I. Many alliances such as the ones between the Britain and Belgium helped to escalate the war into the global conflict that it became. Because America had not entered into any peacetime alliances it was able to stay out of WWI for as long as it did. This idea would also extend to America’s late, official, entrance into WWII. Less than 20 years after Washington’s farewell address, the result in the War of 1812 solidified America’s power on the world stage, and as a force to be reckoned with.

					<h4>War of 1812</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The War of 1812 was the first time that the US formally declared war. While the result of the war had no inherent value for America, its ability to stand up against the forces of Native Americans and Britain showed that America had significant power on the world stage and set the precedent to be able to influence other international issues in the future. One of the causes of the war was expansion into indian territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase, and expansion over the rest of the continent was a reason for many diplomatic relations and conflicts in the 19th century.

			<article id="Expansion">
				<header>
					<h4>Expansion</h4>
				</header>
				<p>A few main highlights in American expansion and its role in foreign policy are James K. Polk’s “54’ 40” or fight” campaign for Oregon and the Mexican-American War. These events were major acquisitions of land for America and represented its power in negotiation and battle between other countries. The acquisition of Mexican territory after the Mexican-American War came at a much cheaper price than originally negotiated. Polk’s insistence on obtaining the Oregon Territory also shows how America’s power as a world power increased substantially during the period of expansion. Expansion always had a sub goal of spreading American ideals into new lands. While this is not what NATO did, the role that NATO played in America’s foreign policy and the Cold War containment policies were crucial during the time period.
				</p>

			<article id="NATO">
				<header>
					<h4>NATO</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The North American Treaty Organization was America’s first permanent peacetime alliance since Washington warned against it in his farewell address 150 years prior. Even though Washington warned against such alliances, it has yet to be proven disastrous, and if anything prevented a nuclear war at the height of the Cold War. Unlike foreign policy during the majority of the 19th century which was about land acquisition, NATO was about peacetime protection from the Soviet Union. During the time period after World War II, the United States became a permanent player on the world stage, with much larger stakes at hand as globalization became much more prominent.

					<h4>United Nations</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The United Nations was founded in the aftermath of World War II with the goal of uniting all countries and reducing the risk of another world war. After the failure of the League of Nations without US participation, world leaders were determined not to repeat history. As a member of the allies in WWII, America earned a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. This was a major increase in US foreign power as it had a permanent seat on the most powerful UN council. The US has used this power to spread its influence abroad during and after the cold war, especially in the war on terror.

					<h4>Middle East - Post 9/11</h4>
				</header>
				<p>America has played a major role in the Middle Eastern conflicts that have broken out after the end of the Cold War. The swift victory in the Persian Gulf War forced Iraq out of Kuwait with the help of UN countries, and after the attacks on September 11, greatly increased its influence in the Middle East. Starting with the Afghanistan War for harboring terrorists, and spreading to Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein for having weapons of mass destruction, US presence in the region has increased significantly since before the attacks. George Bush’s Axis of Evil speech said that America was entering a war for freedom against countries that suppressed it. Other intervention in the area includes the Iran Deal which prevented Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and recent missile strikes on Syria.

					<h4>Colonialism</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Frederick Jackson Turner’s Frontier Thesis states that American history is a history of westward expansion, so it would do no justice to skip the original westward expansion, colonization. Many European countries were in a scramble to colonize the New World. The vast expanse of land offered natural resources, religious freedom, and economic opportunities for all. When examining the origins of colonists in America, the original reason for migration is correlated with region with many connections that still exist today. Soon after colonists expanded into America, they were already spreading westward. Movements for expansion include Bacon’s Rebellion, some even escalate into full on wars, such as the French and Indian War.

			<article id="FrenchIndianWar">

					<h4>French and Indian War</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Skipping forward to the American Revolution, a major spark was the Proclamation Line of 1763, which prohibited expansion past the Appalachian Mountains. This angered colonists because they had just fought in the French and Indian War to be able to expand into this land, and now they would not be able to anymore. As with almost all wars, wars in early American history, especially wars inspired by manifest destiny had the end goal of territory in mind.
				</p>

			<article id="ManifestDestinyExpand">

					<h4>Manifest Destiny</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Manifest Destiny is the idea that Americans are entitled to expand west across the continent. There were many notable instances during the 1800s westwards expansion, such as the Mexican-American War and “54’40” or fight.” Like the French and Indian War, these events mainly had territorial goals in mind. After America had expanded to span the entire continent, policy of expansion moved towards defense of territory and imperialism. The first instance of this happening in the Monroe Doctrine which states that America would protect independent nations in North and South America from European takeover and rule.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="MonroeDoctrine">
				<header>
					<h4>Monroe Doctrine</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Monroe Doctrine was mainly a policy of protection of independent nations in the New World, from Old World countries. This would be an important part of American foreign policy and how it would interact with smaller nations with influence in presidents from Grant to Kennedy. The doctrine states that America will protect independent nations in the New World from takeover my European countries. While not a direct form of imperialism such as in overseas US territories, the influence that the United States had on newly independent nations because of this doctrine is immense and displays America’s negative views towards colonialism. One major influence that the Monroe Doctrine had was on the Roosevelt Corollary which expanded the doctrine to expand the United State’s power stated in the doctrine.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article id="RooseveltCorollary">

					<h4>Roosevelt Corollary</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The Roosevelt Corollary is an expansion of the Monroe Doctrine which expands the power of the United States to be a policing force of the western hemisphere. The corollary specifically granted the ability to put armed forces in Latin American countries to interfere with European conflicts. This is a major shift from the Monroe Doctrine in that it sets the precedent for America to be the policing force in the New World for the rest of the century. This precedent is especially important during the Cold War in which the United States Central Intelligence Committee backed coups in Guatemala, Chile and Iran.

					<h4>CIA Coups</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The CIA backed coups in many countries around the world drastically changed world history. The rulers put into power were often worse in a humanitarian sense than previous rulers, but the only thing that mattered was that communists were not in power. While again, this is a less conventional method of imperialism, it still worked to give America foreign power when an outright war for territory was not an option. In addition to the selected leaders, coups helped to spread the idea of American exceptionalism, which unsurprisingly led to the hate of America in some of these countries. Much like traditional expansion, the CIA coups give more influence and power to America even though it came relatively late as a power to the world stage and was experiencing trouble in the politically tense Cold War.
